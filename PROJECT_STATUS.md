## 🏆 Completion Summary

### Phase 0-3: Foundation, scrapers POC, frontend integration ✅ COMPLETE (2026-06-16 → 2026-07-02)
Docker Compose scaffold, Instagram OCR-based scraper POC, mock store scrapers
(Aroma/Voli/HDL/IDEA), first working price-matrix frontend. Superseded by
Phase 4 below — the mock scrapers described in the original Phase 1-3 docs
(`PHASE_1_COMPLETION.md`, `PHASE_2_COMPLETION.md`, `PHASE_3_PLAN.md`) were
removed once the real cijene.me-based scraper (Phase 4) replaced them.

### Phase 4.0-4.6: Accounts, shopping lists, admin panel, localization ✅ COMPLETE (2026-07-13 → 2026-07-17)
Full detail in [PHASE_4_PLAN.md](PHASE_4_PLAN.md); summary:
- **4.0** — quick UI fixes, 2 new locale stubs (srb/bos)
- **4.1** — guest shopping lists (no login), shareable link, 30-day TTL
- **4.2** — accounts (email+password AND magic-link), saved/multiple lists, tier limits
- **4.3** — stores admin (CRUD, replaces hardcoded mock store list)
- **4.4** — admin panel (auth-gated, tiers CMS, user management)
- **4.5** — scraper agents in admin (manage/run the real cijene.me scraper from the UI)
- **4.6** — localization unification (6 locales: ukr/rus/mne/srb/bos/eng, one
  `Lang` type, one URL-locale source of truth), product name translation
  (`name_i18n` + free dictionary translator, see 2026-07-17 follow-up below),
  language-aware search
- **Real scraping replaced mocks**: the current live data source is
  `cijene_scraper.py` (cijene.me aggregator, covers Aroma/Voli/HDL/IDEA in one
  scrape) + an Instagram mock, orchestrated by
  `app/services/scrapers/orchestrator.py`. The Phase 1-3 mock scrapers
  (`aroma_mock_scraper.py`, `hdl_mock_scraper.py`, `idea_mock_scraper.py`,
  `voli_mock_scraper.py`) and the Instagram OCR pipeline (`instagrapi`,
  Tesseract) referenced throughout this doc's older sections below are no
  longer part of the live pipeline.

### 2026-07-17 follow-up: real product-name translations + 2 search bugfixes
- `grocery_dictionary.py` — free, deterministic word-level translator (no API
  key needed), backfilled `name_i18n` for 281/287 (98%) real products.
- Fixed two bugs that silently broke `/search/products` for any query (missing
  MongoDB text index; a response model requiring a field that's always `None`
  on real data).
- Fixed the landing-page hero search bar (was pure unwired UI) and the
  "create shopping list" search (was re-running a full ~10-15s live scrape on
  every modal open instead of filtering already-loaded data).

Full detail: `PROJECT_MAP.md` → "Bugfix (2026-07-17, 2 частини)" and
`CLAUDE.md` → changelog entries 21-22.

### Not yet done
- [ ] Production deployment (this app has never been deployed — see the
  ⚠️ note under Deployment below about `DEPLOYMENT.md`'s target server)
- [ ] Automated scheduled scraping is in place (weekly Monday 07:00 Kyiv via
  APScheduler) but not yet verified running unattended in production
- [ ] Category header labels (Овочі/Молочка/...) are hardcoded Ukrainian
  regardless of UI locale — not yet localized (separate, smaller known gap)

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Backend Stack
- **Framework:** FastAPI (async)
- **Database:** MongoDB (primary — native Windows service for local dev, not
  Docker; PostgreSQL/Redis exist in `docker-compose.yml` but aren't required
  for the current feature set)
- **Auth:** Session cookie (HttpOnly JWT), email+password AND magic-link
- **Scraping:** `cijene_scraper.py` (real, aggregator site) + Instagram mock,
  via `app/services/scrapers/orchestrator.py`
- **Translation:** `grocery_dictionary.py` (free, deterministic) with an
  optional Groq AI fallback (`translation_service.py`)
- **Scheduling:** APScheduler (weekly Monday 07:00 Kyiv)

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 + React 19
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4 (v3-style config via `@config` compat layer —
  see the documented `max-w-*`/spacing-scale collision gotcha in
  `PROJECT_MAP.md`)
- **i18n:** next-intl, 6 locales, URL locale segment is the single source of
  truth for the `Lang` type (`lib/productMatrix.ts`)
- **HTTP:** Axios

### Local Development (current, not Docker)
- **Backend:** `venv/Scripts/python.exe -m uvicorn app.main:app --port 8001`
- **Frontend:** `npm run dev -- -p 3001`
- **MongoDB:** native Windows service on `localhost:27017` (see `.env` comment)
- Ports **3001**/**8001** are the real, currently-used ports — not 3003/8001
  as described in the Docker-based sections further down this document.

## 🚀 Deployment Status

**Deployed (2026-07-17).** Live at http://138.199.204.107:3010 (admin:
http://138.199.204.107:3010/ukr/admin), backend at
http://138.199.204.107:8010. Full deployment detail, memory-safety measures,
and known follow-ups: `CLAUDE.md` changelog entry 23.

The target-server question flagged in the previous version of this section
(same Hetzner VPS as `hrd-minion`) was raised with the user and **explicitly
confirmed** — shared infrastructure, accepted knowingly. `kartiq-backend` and
`kartiq-frontend` were stopped (not removed - `supervisorctl start
kartiq-backend` / `pm2 start kartiq-frontend` to bring back) to free memory
on an already tight box (232Mi free, 0 swap before this deploy - a 2GB
swapfile was added as a safety net, and MongoDB's cache was capped to
avoid it happening again).

### ⚠️ Still before this is a "real" production setup
- [ ] Domain + SSL/HTTPS (currently plain HTTP on raw ports; the session
  cookie is deliberately non-`Secure` to work over HTTP - **must** be
  revisited once a domain exists, see `CLAUDE.md` entry 23)
- [ ] Resend API key (magic-link email doesn't actually send yet - the
  bootstrapped admin account uses email+password instead)
- [ ] Set up database backups (MongoDB has zero backup/snapshot strategy)
- [ ] Configure monitoring + logging beyond supervisord's stdout/stderr files
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) - deploys are still manual SSH
- [ ] Decide whether to restore `kartiq-backend`/`kartiq-frontend` or leave
  them off; the server is memory-constrained enough that running everything
  at once isn't comfortably safe

## 🎯 Next Steps

`LOCAL_SETUP.md` and `DEPLOYMENT.md` already exist (items 1-2 of the original
list here are done) — see the ⚠️ deployment-target note above before using
`DEPLOYMENT.md`. Remaining open items:

1. **Production Deployment** — resolve the target-server question, then
   actually deploy (never done yet).
2. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Add health check endpoints
   - Configure logging (structlog + JSON format)
   - Add metrics collection
3. **CI/CD Pipeline** (Optional)
   - GitHub Actions workflow
   - Automated testing
4. **Category header localization** — `Овочі`/`Молочка`/etc. are hardcoded
   Ukrainian regardless of UI locale (`category_map.py` on the backend);
   noted in `PROJECT_MAP.md`, not yet scheduled.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Local Development)

**Current, actually-used setup** (native, not Docker — see `LOCAL_SETUP.md`
for the full guide):

```bash
# 1. Backend (Terminal 1)
cd backend
venv/Scripts/python.exe -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001

# 2. Frontend (Terminal 2)
cd frontend
npm run dev -- -p 3001

# 3. Access
# Frontend: http://localhost:3001/ukr  (or /rus /mne /srb /bos /eng)
# Backend:  http://localhost:8001
# API Docs: http://localhost:8001/docs
# MongoDB:  native Windows service, localhost:27017 (not Docker)
```

### Docker Compose (original design, not the current dev workflow)

The sections below (file structure, data flow, Docker services) describe the
original Phase 0-3 design and may not exactly match today's file layout — see
`PROJECT_MAP.md` for what's actually in the codebase now.

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd insta-data

# 2. Copy .env files
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local

# 3. Update frontend/.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# 4. Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# 5. Wait 30 seconds
sleep 30

# 6. Access
# Frontend: http://localhost:3003
# Backend: http://localhost:8001
# API Docs: http://localhost:8001/docs
```

**Project Status: 🟢 DEPLOYED — http://138.199.204.107:3010 (feature-complete for Phase 4.0-4.6)**

Real cijene.me scraping | 6 locales | Accounts + shopping lists + admin panel | Live, no domain/SSL yet

Next: domain + HTTPS (and flip the session cookie back to `Secure` once there's one). See [PROJECT_MAP.md](PROJECT_MAP.md) for current status.
